A simpler version of War.  

#### Step 1.

### Step 4.
- Do steps 1-3 using classes

### Step 5.
- Play each card in order against each other (total of 10 times as there are 10 cards) and show the number of wins for each player 

### Step 6.

Assignment
- Use the enhancedClass.js to continue work.
1. Add a third player and log each player's wins after playing all 10 cards against each other
2. Add a new method to the `Manager Class` called `play` that will run the method `whoWins` 10 times in the same way we set up 
```
manager.whoWins(1);
manager.whoWins(2);
manager.whoWins(3);
...
```
3. Enhance the Manager Class to take 3 players in through its constructor
